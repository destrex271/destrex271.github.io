In the last installment for this particular story, I had finally landed in Prague with Rajiv just in time for the Conference Reception. Although we had missed a few talks by then like [Should I use JSON in PostgreSQL**?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALxu-QioZpE) **-** by Boriss Mejias, [‘Understanding and fixing Autovaccum’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a1otYLZxy4)— by Robert Hass, ‘[It’s not you, It’s me: Breaking up with Massive Tables via Partitioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TafwSuLNxe8)’ — by Chelsea Dole and ‘[Add Geocoordinates to your addresses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssDxdA3iLmQ)’ — by Andreas Scherbaum. Well, now they have been uploaded to YouTube so you know what I had been upto for the past few days ;).

#### Day I: 14th December, 2023

This was a very exciting day indeed. I had received my own lanyard on the previous day. I got the amazing opportunity to attend the following sessions in Person.

Advanced Authentication and Encrypted Connections — by Stephen Frost

I also had the amazing chance to host 3 consecutive talks from industry professionals on PostgreSQL and how it fits in with all the new and upcoming technologies. I also got to meet many amazing people at the conference while attending the talks.

#### Day II: 15th December, 2023

This was perhaps one of the most eventful days of my career; period.

The day began with one of the talks that I had been really excited about: ‘[Blazingly Fast Message Queue on Postgres with Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2C7gktfoQ)’ — by Adam Hendel. This talk went over the PGMQ utility developed at Tembo which in my opinion is doing really cool work and has been successful in showcasing the raw powers of PostgreSQL.

This was also the day when I was supposed to deliver my talk at the conference. Although I was nervous, the entire talk went pretty smoothly with a set of audience that was really interested in the project. You can check out the recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt61WBiWVgQ).

During the talk at PgConf Europe

I also got to interact with Stephen Frost who was my mentor for the project during GSoC’23 and Magnus Hagander whom I had interacted the most via email earlier while reporting bugs found by the testing harness. Overall it was a humbling experience and I realized that there is a lot more to software engineering than just writing code. I am really grateful to PostgreSQL Europe for this amazing opportunity and to the entire PostgreSQL community for showing their love and support at the conference.

I look forward to contributing more to PostgreSQL and learning more about the world of Databases and Distributed Systems!

Thanks for reading!
