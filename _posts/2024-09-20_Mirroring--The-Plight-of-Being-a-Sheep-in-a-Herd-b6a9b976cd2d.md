### **Mirroring: The Plight of Being a Sheep in a Herd**

This blog is a bit different from my usual posts, which mainly focus on my ventures in the tech world. However, this is something I find myself pondering.

***P.S.:*** *The points in this blog are strictly my thoughts and opinions. I am not a trained professional in this field, so please take everything I say with an analytical eye.*

Mirroring is a behavioral pattern that we humans have acquired over the course of evolution. This primal behavior is one of the mechanisms that help people bond. Although we adults might feel that we have moved beyond this primal nature, my observations of people during my limited lifespan have led me to believe otherwise. We humans are social animals; we may try to escape our primal instincts, but the truth is that it’s not an easy task.

My personal experiences at university have spanned both personal and professional levels. Sometimes, you might notice yourself using language similar to that of the people you hang out with, or even developing similar interests in your profession. You may also observe that people around you adopt some of your habits.

This behavior serves a purpose of survival, even today. We are easily influenced by social media, the latest trends, and even the most charismatic figures around us. Animals exhibit similar behaviors to fit into packs or tribes, but we need to realize that as humans, we have the gift of consciousness — the ability to think for ourselves, to detach from our primal needs, and to control what our senses (indriyan, as we say in Hindi/Sanskrit) perceive.

It’s not only our DNA or fingerprints that make each individual unique (even these can be similar for twins!), but our perspectives on life, our thoughts, and our actions set us apart from others. Based on my experiences, if it seems that being with a certain group of people is diminishing your intellect and making you a sheep in a herd, it’s better to detach for some time and focus on yourself. This might seem like a rigid step to take back control of your life, thoughts, and values, but I’ve found it to be useful for now.

I’m not saying it’s bad to learn new things from our peers. In fact, that’s what helps us break our limits. However, simply copying someone else’s actions won’t get you far in life. For example, there was a trend of “dropout billionaires” a while back. People watched movies like “ *Jobs”* and “*The Social Network”* and read about some of the most successful dropouts in the world. As a result, many began dismissing college degrees. While I’m not saying that a college degree is required for success, making alarming claims that dropping out of university will make you a billionaire is just pure garbage. If you want to learn from these dropouts, focus on why they dropped out, the actual effort they invested to achieve their success, and the people they surrounded themselves with. It’s important to remember that without Wozniak, Steve Jobs couldn’t have started Apple. Therefore, surrounding yourself with the right people while developing a sense of individuality is crucial.

Switching gears, I firmly believe that it is absolutely possible to achieve anything in this world. However, we must realize that merely copying others and taking the same steps they did won’t solve our problems.

We only have one life. Instead of “YOLOing” with people who drag you down mentally and undermine your ambitions, learn to stand on your own and surround yourself with those who will be there for you during your darkest moments. Even if you don’t have those people yet, don’t worry; you always have yourself, a person you know inside and out.

In conclusion, let’s remember that this world is temporary; nothing that exists here can last forever. We should recognize the fleeting nature of our reality and strive to make the best use of our time by choosing our actions wisely. People come and go in your life, but you remain with yourself until your last breath. You know what you’ve worked for, your goals, and your capabilities, so don’t let your primal nature take control. Instead, tame it to your advantage.
